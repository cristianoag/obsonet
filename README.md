# Obsonet Reloaded
This is the GitHub repository to host all source files for the Obsonet Reloaded. 

The ObsoNET is the first network card created for the MSX. In 2004, the hardware designer Daniel Berdugo and software developer Nestor Soriano joined forces to create a cartridge to bring ETHERNET standard to the MSX line of computers. 

The cartridge is based on the Realtek RTL8019AS chip and uses a flash memory to host and execute a BIOS that allows the use of network commands from the Nextor operating system (compatible with MSXDOS). An EPROM stores basic configuration data for the RTL8019AS chip and a side connector is used to plug a network cable to your MSX. A GAL16VB is used to implement the logic required to activate and expose the cartridge to the computer.

## Hardware 

The files required to build the original version of the Obsonet are available [https://github.com/msx-solis/obsonet](here). You can download the gerber files and order from any PCB manufacturer.

I have created another version of the PCB that I called Obsonet Reloaded. The goal was to have the board fitting the standard Patola cartridge cases available in Brazil as well as the standard Konami cases available from multiple vendors WW.

## Software

On this repo you can find all software required to build and use the Obsonet Reloaded. There are also binary files with fixes for small issues we found during the project.

## Resources

I wrote an article providing more information on how to acquire components and build the new version of the cartridge. You can check it on my blog at [http://www.theretrohacker.com/2022/11/04/the-obsonet-cartridge-for-the-msx/](http://www.theretrohacker.com/2022/11/04/the-obsonet-cartridge-for-the-msx/).

I also have a video in Portuguese showing the board, software, issues we faced during the remodel project as well as showing how to use it to download and use software on your MSX. Please check it at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph_3VFheo2I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph_3VFheo2I)
